**  the time indicated in this structure is the system base time.  If the
**	current implementation is a multi-user type system, or one in a
**	widely distributed network, then the base time should be something 
**	based on GMT, with the system converting to local time as needed.  
**	If, however, the implementation is a simple non-networking machine,
**	the base time may be local time.
**
**  the driver does not know anything about normal calendar arithmetic or
**	daylight savings time, or what century it is (that is up to the 
**	system, or anything other than keeping an increment in ms, seconds, 
**	minutes, etc from the base time with which it was
**	initialized.
