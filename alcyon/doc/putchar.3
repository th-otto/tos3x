.sh NAME
putchar - write a character
.sh SYNOPSIS
.ft B
int getchar(c)
.br
char c;
.ft R
.sh DESCRIPTION
Putchar writes one character to the standard output (VERSAdos file #6).
Putchar assumes it is writting ASCII characters and buffers all
characters until a '\\n' is received.  Then the '\\n' is stripped
from the buffer and the record is written.  Tab characters are left
as '\\t' -- they are not translated into the VERSAdos convention
of a negative number.  Putchar returns the character received for
success and returns a negative integer for failure.

Putchar may aso be used to write ASCII characters to a file other than
the standard output.  If the external variable named fout is set to
any valid file descriptor, then putchar writes to that file rather
than the standard output.  The routine named flush which writes
any characters in the putchar output buffer may be called to
force a write; however, writes occur automatically at the end
of each record ('\\n' delimiter).
