.th GETCHAR
.sh NAME
getchar \*- read character
.sh SYNOPSIS
.ft B
int getchar( )
.br
.ft R
.sh DESCRIPTION
Getchar reads records from the standard input (VERSAdos file #5)
into a buffer and returns these characters one per call to the
user.  Getchar assumes that it is reading ASCII records.  It
places a '\\n' character on the end of each record, and translates
the VERSAdos tab character (any negative character) into a '\\t'.
Getchar returns a negative number for EOF or read error.
Since all VERSAdos I/O is record I/O, getchar must be buffered,
and thus is not any less efficient than getc.
