teksendc68 - 68000 downloader
.us USAGE
teksendc68 [-] objectfile [ttyname]
.fn FUNCTION
Teksendc68
reads the objectfile, which must be in the c.out format produced
by the 68000 linking loader lo68.  Teksendc68 converts this executable
object code into the Tektronix Extended TEKHEX format acceptable by
the 8540 for the 68000 and writes this TEKHEX to the output file.
.sp
If the optional third argument (ttyname) is
present, this is the name of the special file (ie. /dev/tty?) to use
to download the 68000.  If this optional third argument is not
present, the standard output file is used.
.sp
If the optional "-" argument is specified, teksendc68 does not clear
the bss segment during the load.  This results in a faster load, but
all bss memory will have random initial values.
