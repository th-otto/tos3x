.fn FUNCTION
prints the symbol table from the output file of an
68000 assembler (as68) or loader (lo68) run.
Each symbol name is followed by its value
and one or more of the following type descriptors: equ (equated), global,
equreg (equated register), external, data, text, bss, abs (absolute).
The output is not sorted and thus appears in the order that the
symbols appear in the file's symbol table.
