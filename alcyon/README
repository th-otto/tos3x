This directory contains the sources of the C compiler and
utilities that i used to compile TOS. They are functional identical
to the ones in the developer kit, but with numerous bugs fixed
that made them difficult to use:

- fopen() has been changed to understand a "b" parameter, and
  pass it along to the low-level read/write calls.

- obsolete functions like fopena have been removed from the library.

- the stdio library has been changed to handle streams opened for
  reading+writing.

- Most of the bugs mentioned in the original source files have been fixed.

- The assembler has been substantely changed to
  - not require the as68symb.dat file anymore
  - understand short absolute address form
  so that it can now be used to assemble all the hand-written assembler files.

Note that, despite all the fixes, no changes were made (especially to the compiler)
that would lead to different code generation.

Finished:
	- cp68.ttp (preprocessor)
	- c068.ttp (C parser)
	- c168.ttp (C code generator)
	- optimize.ttp (peephole optimizer)
	- link68.ttp (original CPM linker)
	- relmod.ttp (convert output of link68 to GEMDOS format)
	- nm68.ttp (symbol print utility)
	- size68.ttp (utility to print section sizes)

Missing:
	- ar68.ttp (archive utility)
	- aln.ttp (Atari's version of linker)
	- doindex.ttp (create symbol index for aln)


The sources of the original versions of these tools can be found in the "orig"
directory.
