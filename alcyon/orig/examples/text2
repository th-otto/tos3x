From the "Devil's Dictionary":  
A penny saved is a penny to squander.
A man is known by the company he organizes.
A bird in the hand is worth what it will bring.
Think twice before you speak to a friend in need.
He laughs best who laughs least.
Least said is soonest disavowed.  
Speak of the Devil and he will hear about it.  
Of two evils choose to be the least.  
Strike while your employer has a big contract.
Where there's a will there's a won't.
