- change for (init; cond; expr) into
  init;
  for (;;)
  {
     if (!cond) break;
     ...
     expr;
  }

- change continue in some for loops into goto start of loop


- a few programs in the original developer kit (e.g. optimize.prg)
  had a symbol table. Since, due to the way the linker works, it is
  almost impossible to reproduce a symbol table in the same
  order, it has been stripped from the binary in order to be able
  to compare the output files.

- some programs had additional zeroes at the end of the relocation
  table (maybe padding from the CPM pip command). These have been
  dropped in order to be able to compare the output files.
