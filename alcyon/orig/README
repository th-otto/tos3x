This directory contains the sources of the C compiler and
utilities that compile to identical versions of the ones
found in the developer kit, with only a few differences:

- a few programs in the original developer kit (e.g. optimize.prg)
  had a symbol table. Since, due to the way the linker works, it is
  almost impossible to reproduce a symbol table in the same
  order, it has been stripped from the binary in order to be able
  to compare the output files.

- some programs had additional zeroes at the end of the relocation
  table (maybe padding from the CPM pip command). These have been
  dropped in order to be able to compare the output files.

- at a few places, short assembler statements are included, to
  work around code differences for files that were apparently compiled
  with a slightly different compiler than the one in the package.
