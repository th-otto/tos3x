- Assembler sources are written in a format that is accepted
  both by as68 and by the GNU assembler with the --mri option.
  If you have to use a different assembler, they might need
  conversion.

- Don't put comments after constants that are used in assembler
  expressions. Since it is a K&R preprocessor, the spaces between
  the constant and the comment will make it to the source, and
  the assembler does not like spaces in operands.

- Assembliing the assembler sources in the bios directory with
  the original as68 from the developer kit will not work, mostly
  because it does not support abs.w addressing mode, but also due
  to numerous bugs. Either use the fixed version from the bin
  directory or try some other assembler.
